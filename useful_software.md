# Useful software for Ubuntu 20.04 on Asus ZenBook Pro Duo UX581LV

The first thing I did was to watch the videos [50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNX7HgcWqHc) and [20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrI5c9PXS5k&list=PLt810f_2DOzQ8PZAFzlP7FGUs4gewxZ9I&index=1) things to do after installing Ubuntu 20.04. This included downloading tlp for battery life, tweaks for customization, gnome-restricted-extras and many other useful things. Below I have listed explanations of and links to software not included in these videos.

## OLED Dimmer
Install the [OLED Dimmer](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1222/oled-dimmer/) extension to be able to control the brightness of the screens with the default key bindings.

## Facial recognition
Install **Howdy** as explained [here](https://tech.davidfield.co.uk/unlock-ubuntu-using-your-face/) to be able to log in to your computer, unlock lock screen and obtain `sudo` access in the terminal using facial recognition instead of your password.
